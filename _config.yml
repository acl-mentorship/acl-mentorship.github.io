# Team Block
teamBlockTitle: "About us"
aboutUs: "Motivated by the rapidly growing community of NLP, every year we see many junior students joining the NLP community. However, not all people have the same resources and can receive similar guidance to develop a smooth research/career path in NLP. This difference is exacerbated by the region, cultural group, and many other factors that make resources unequally distributed. Inspired by the one-time mentorship sessions at NLP conferences, we are thinking whether we could make mentorship resources more available all around the year and around the world.
